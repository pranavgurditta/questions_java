/*You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct

        replaceAll(String regex, String replacement) is a method of String objects that replaces any parts of the string that matches the provided regular expression (regex) with a replacement. In regex, "[ ]" matches characters that in the bracket; e.g. "[abc]" matches any "a", "b", or "c". "[^ ]" matches characters not in the bracket; e.g. "[^ab]" will match "c" in String "abc". String J was concatenated to "[^" and "]" to create the regex "[^ (all characters in J) ]" in order to replace any characters of S that is not in J with a blank "".
