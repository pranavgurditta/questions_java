L137:
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

L136:
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

L190:
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

L268:  
Question: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

L338:
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

L461:
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
